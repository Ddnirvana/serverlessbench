# Online Compiling Application

Online compiling application is ported from [gg project](https://github.com/StanfordSNR/gg). We add a backend engine to adapt to online compiling on OpenWhisk framework.

While [gg](https://github.com/StanfordSNR/gg) is capable of running various applications, e.g. Bulid System, ExCamera, Unit Testing, and Video Encoding (see gg's original README (README_GG) for more details), ServerlessBench only make use of it as examples of serverless online compiling application. Specifically, examples/make and examples/llvm are included in the evaluation entities.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT:

The majority of codes of Online compiling application is borrowed from [gg project](https://github.com/StanfordSNR/gg), with adaptation to OpenWhisk framework.
